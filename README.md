# Hill-Climb-Racing-Trainer-CheatEngine
This is the CT file of cheat engine that you can use if you have "Cheat Engine" installed. For now, I've added 4 essential mods and 2 extra as a disable feature. Enjoy

# How to use the mod?
To use the mod, you first need to install Cheat Engine. The guide of how to install Cheat Engine and activate cheats is in one of my repository. 
Here is the link, follow the steps and install Cheat Engine. [Step By Step Guide on Cheat Engine](https://github.com/AadityaKandel/BB-RACING-CHEAT-ENGINE-SCRIPT?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-use-the-mod)

- While selecting the process, I hope you are smart enough to know that you need to open "HillClimbRacing.exe" process similar to Step 6.-
- However, before going to step 6, you must've opened Hill Climb Racing Game and fully loaded it.
- Now, you can read Step 7 which guides you on how to activate the cheats.
- ENJOY!!
